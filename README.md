## 🚀 Hey everyone!

I'm excited to finally share something I've been building — a **web application designed specifically for students and lecturers** who are tired of overpriced platforms and lifeless learning tools that don’t really meet our needs.

This project is really close to my heart. I started it back in **2020**, during my **second year of university**, right in the middle of the COVID-19 lockdown. At the time, I didn’t have the experience to complete it — the requirements felt overwhelming. But I didn’t give up.

Fast forward a few years — with more skills and perspective — I’ve picked it back up, rebuilt it, and I’m proud to say: **it’s now live and fully functional!** 🙌
