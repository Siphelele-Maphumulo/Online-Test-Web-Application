🚀 Hey everyone!
It's me again, and I’m excited to share something I’ve been working on — a web application built especially for students and teachers who are tired of overpriced subscriptions and robotic platforms that don’t really understand us.
🎓 This project is close to my heart. I first started it back in 2020 during my second year of university, right in the middle of COVID-19. Back then, I couldn’t finish it because of how complex the requirements were. But I’ve revisited it with fresh eyes and better skills — and I’m proud to say it’s now live and functional! 🙌
🛠️ Built mainly with Java and MySQL, the app allows both students and lecturers to sign up and access different dashboards.
 👨‍🏫 Lecturers can create, edit, and delete tests and courses.
 🧑‍🎓 Students can take exams and view their results instantly.
Deploying a 5-year-old project wasn't easy, but I made it work using tools like GlassFish, Tomcat, and Docker, and hosted it via Render.
👉 Try it out, explore the features, and let me know what you think! Feedback is welcome — tell me what works, what doesn’t, and what features you'd like to see added.
